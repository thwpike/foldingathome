This is a series of scripts and files to create a minimal CD, USB or network
bootable image that will run a Folding@Home client instance.

The Folding CD can only be built on a 64bit (x86_64) system. It will build an
image that will work for both 64bit(x86_64) and 32bit(i686) systems.

The Diskless Folding zip file (for PXE boot) is derived from The Folding CD
and is also built. It appears as diskless.zip in the base directory.

The Folding USB stick zip file (for USB boot) is derived from The Folding CD and
is also built. It appears as usb.zip in the base directory.

The build system uses a standard Makefile. Interesting targets are:
all:         folding_cd.iso diskless.zip usb.zip
install_net: Installs a PXE boot in to /var/lib/tftpboot
install_web: Publishes everything to /var/www/reilly/folding including scripts
             and necessary files to /usr/lib/cgi-bin

The Folding CD makes use of the following Open Source Software
licensed under the GPLv2:
Linux Kernel
Syslinux
Busybox
GlibC

In order to build, you will need an up to date installation of Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS)
with the following additional packages installed:
apt-get install nasm zip genisoimage libmpfr-dev libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev \
                libc6-dev-i386 lib32gcc1 gcc-multilib g++-multilib git-core \
                qemu cmake libcap-dev mingw32 libncurses5-dev gettext \
                autoconf libtool texinfo uuid-dev

This software downloads the folding client and cores from Stanford to comply
with the Folding@Home license.
